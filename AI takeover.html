<h2>AI takeover </h2>

<h3>  the definition: </h3>
<p> An  <b>AI takeover</b> is a hypothetical scenario in which some form of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes the dominant form of intelligence on Earth, with computer programs or robots effectively taking the control of the planet away from the human species.</p>
<p> Possible scenarios include replacement of the entire human workforce, takeover by a superintelligent AI, and the popular notion of a robot uprising.</p>
<p> Some public figures, such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, have advocated research into precautionary measures to ensure future superintelligent machines remain under human control.</p>

  <p> The traditional consensus among economists has been that technological progress does not cause long-term unemployment. However, recent innovation in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence has raised worries that human labor will become obsolete, leaving people in various sectors without jobs to earn a living, leading to an economic crisis.</p>
  <p>  Many small and medium size businesses may also be driven out of business if they will not be able to afford or licence the latest robotic and AI technology, and may need to focus on areas or services that cannot easily be replaced for continued viability in the face of such technology.</p>

  <p> <a href="/wiki/Computer-integrated_manufacturing" title="">Computer-integrated manufacturing</a>is the manufacturing approach of using computers to control the entire production process.  </p>
  <p>This integration allows individual processes to exchange information with each other and initiate actions.</p>
  <p>Although manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone by the integration of computers, the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes. </p>
  <p>Computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive, aviation, space, and ship building industries. </p>

  <li>White-collar machines </li>
  <p> The 21st century has seen a variety of skilled tasks partially taken over by machines, including translation, legal research and even low level journalism.</p>
  <p>Care work, entertainment, and other tasks requiring empathy, previously thought safe from automation, have also begun to be performed by robots.</p>
 <li>Autonomous cars </li>
 <p>  an <a href="/wiki/Self-driving_car" title="Self-driving car">autonomous car</a>is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input.  </p>
 <p> Many such vehicles are being developed, but as of May 2017 automated cars permitted on public roads are not yet fully autonomous. They all require a human driver at the wheel who is ready at a moment's notice to take control of the vehicle.  </p>
 <p>Among the main obstacles to widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, are concerns about the resulting loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry. </p>
