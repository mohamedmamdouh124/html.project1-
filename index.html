 <h2> introduction</h2>
<h3> the definition: </h3>
<p>It is a branch of computer science. Much of the literature defines artificial intelligence, as: “the study and design of intelligent customers.” An intelligent customer is a system that understands its environment and takes positions that increase its chance of success in achieving its mission or team mission. </p>
<p>This definition, in terms of goals, actions, perception, and environment is due to Russell & Norvig (2003) and other definitions also include knowledge and learning as additional criteria. Computer scientist John McCarthy originally coined the term in 1956, defining it himself as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines". Andreas Kaplan and Michael Heinlein define artificial intelligence as “the ability of a system to correctly interpret external data, learn from that data, and use that knowledge to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.” </p>

<h3>types of artificial intelligence </h3>
<ui> 
    <li>Narrow AI </li>
    <p> It is artificial intelligence that specializes in one area.</p>
    <li> artificial general intelligence</li>
   <p>This type refers to computers with the level of human intelligence in all fields, that is, it can perform any intellectual task that a person can perform. Creating this type of intelligence is much more difficult than the previous type and we have not reached this level yet.</p>
    <li> Super Artificial Intelligence </li>
    <p> Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defined superintelligence as “thought far smarter than the best human minds in nearly every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.” Because of this type, the field of artificial intelligence is an interesting area to delve into.</p>

<h3>Artificial intelligence features</h3>
<p> Artificial intelligence has many characteristics that made it an effective investment in many fields</p>
<ui> 
        <li> The application of artificial intelligence to machines and machines enables them to plan and analyze problems using logic.</li>
        <li>Recognizes sounds, speech, and the ability to move objects. </li>
        <li>AI devices can understand and analyze inputs well to deliver outputs that meet user needs with high efficiency. </li>
        <li>It enables continuous learning, where the learning process is automatic and subjective without being subject to monitoring and supervision. </li>
        <li>It is able to process the vast amount of information it is exposed to </li>
        <li>It can notice similar patterns in data and analyze it more effectively than human brains. </li>
        <li> He can find solutions to unfamiliar problems using his cognitive abilities.  </li>
