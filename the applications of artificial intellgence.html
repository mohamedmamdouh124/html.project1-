  <h2> the applications of artificial intelligence</h2>
    <h3>applications in medicine:</h3>  <img src="https://cdn.al-ain.com/images/2019/1/21/78-103748-system-artificial-intelligence-cancer_700x400.png" alt="robot" width="300" height="225">      <img src="https://yazpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4831c7d6-d63e-4625-8cba-7581edeea5ed.jpg" alt="robot" width="300" height="225">
   <p> The field of health care is developing at an ever-increasing speed, with a significant increase in the amount of data and challenges in terms of cost and patient outcomes; Therefore, artificial intelligence applications have been used to reduce these challenges,[1] and the following are the most important examples of the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in this field:a</p>

    <ui>  
      <li>Predicting ICU transfers:</li>
      <p> Unplanned transfer of patients to the intensive care unit can lead to poor outcomes, and sometimes even death. Therefore, artificial intelligence has been used to reduce the proportion of these cases, by finding patients with serious cases, as artificial intelligence systems use patients’ medical records, laboratory results, and their vital signs to correct the patients’ condition before it deteriorates, and having to transfer them to the intensive care unit, and it can guide Artificial intelligence systems doctors to the point of initiation of treatment</p>
      <li>Medical Testing</li>
      <p> Unnecessary routine laboratory testing increases undue financial costs; Therefore, artificial intelligence applications have been used to narrow the circle of laboratory tests that the patient may need.</p>
      <li>Improving Clinical Workflow</li>
      <li>Predicting Hospital Acquired Infections</li>
  </ui>


  <h3>applications in business: </h3>
      <p> Artificial intelligence helps enhance business capabilities in all areas, and gives companies the ability to demonstrate all their capabilities and raise them to the highest levels. It increases the efficiency of business and the speed of its implementation, increases its value, contributes to the continuous development of business, and increases the number of interacting with these businesses, due to the continuous development of tools and software related to it.</p>

  <h3> applications in daily life</h3>
    <P>Here are some examples of the importance of using artificial intelligence applications in daily life </P>
    <ui>
        <Li> The use of artificial intelligence applications has revolutionized the automotive industry. For example, Google's self-driving program uses artificial intelligence techniques, as do logistics companies such as Uber; To reduce accidents and reduce traffic congestion.</Li>
        <Li> Social networks use artificial intelligence applications, such as: Facebook AI, to detect the presence of a breach of user photos.</Li>   
        <li>Artificial intelligence applications are used in e-commerce websites; Like Amazon, to get a clear picture of customers' behavior in purchases on the site, and to make recommendations. </li>
   </ui> 
    <h3>applications in  invironment:</h3>
         <p>The “exhausted” planet suffers from many fateful problems that threaten the survival of all of us. Here, too, the importance of artificial intelligence appears. It is likely to be very useful in solving the environmental problems we face due to global warming.</p>
     <h3> Improving agricultural productivity:</h3> 
     <p> Robots can be used to grow seeds, fertilize crops and manage pesticides, among many other uses. Farmers can use a drone to monitor the planting of crops as well as collect data for analysis. </p>
     <p>Data collected by AI on variables such as crop health and soil conditions can also be analyzed and used to enhance the final production, and AI can also be used in harvesting, especially for crops that are difficult to produce. </p>
